        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sara Jamal and I'm a senior at FAST NUCES, set to graduate in June 2023. I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for exploring different fields in computer science. Coding has always been one of my favorite activities, and I'm constantly looking for new skills to learn and ways to improve my craft.</p> 

        <p> When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me watching podcasts or surfing the web to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I also enjoy playing badminton and baking as my way of relaxing after a stressful day. I'm excited about the future and can't wait to see where my journey in the tech industry takes me.</p>
